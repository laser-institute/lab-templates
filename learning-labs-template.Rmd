## 1. PREPARE

Start each lab by providing a brief but engaging overview of the topic (e.g., text mining) that you'll be covering over the next two days.

For Lab 1, follow the overview with a quick bulleted list introducing each lab and what they will cover. For example:

-   **Lab 1: Title**. Short description...
-   **Lab 2: Title**. Short description...
-   **Lab 3: Title**. Short description... 
-   **Lab 4: Title**. Short description...

For subsequent labs, provide just a brief overview of the primary topics covered by the lab, along with a with a bulleted list introducing primary topics. Lab 4 for text mining for example, would be something like:

1.  **Prepare**: Short description...
2.  **Wrangle**: Short description...
3.  **Model**: Short description...
4.  **Explore**: Short description...
5.  **Communicate** : Short description...

### 1a. Understand the Context

In Lab 1 you may want to introduce LASER scholars to the study and/or data that will be guiding your first lab and subsequent labs. See example here:

<https://sbkellogg.github.io/eci-588/unit-2/unit-2-walkthrough.html#1a_Some_Context>

In subsequent labs this may be simply a reminder of the literature or data or what they are trying to accomplish with the data and and any new background information that might be needed and is not shared in the opening paragraph(s).

It can also be omitted or just folded into introduction at beginning.

#### Article Title

#### Abstract

Copy and paste abstract...

#### Data and Analysis

Overview of data and analysis and how this guides the analysis they will be performing and the data they will be using...

#### Key Findings

\

### 1c. Load Packages

#### Prior Packages

Brief intro text...

Instruct participants to run the corresponding the code into their guided practice Rmd file since they will need these packages for "Your Turn" exercises:

```{r load-packages}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(tidyr)
```

#### New Packages

Introduce any new packages you'll be using in this lab that they will need immediately and provide a decent explanation of the package. If you're introducing several new packages, they can be introduced in later sections where appropriate.

#### tidytext

Include icon if available and instruct participants to load `package`:

```{r}
library(tidytext)
```
